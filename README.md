# PORTFOLIO
Hello, I'm Laurensia! Welcome to my portfolio!

I'm Laurensia, computer science major interested in Artificial Intelligence and Data Scienceâœ¨.

I'm best at python and learning R. I am also currently learning Web Development with Flask. Other tools/langs i enjoy such as:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Python, R, C/C++, C#, SQL, Java

<br/>

Portfolio contain compilation of personal project, mainly Data Science and Machine Learning projects, updated on regular basis.

<img align="left" src="img/1_kny.png" width="240" height="144"> **[Anime Recommender System: Content-based and Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/laurensiavee/anime-recommender)**<br>
**Information Retrieval | TF-IDF | KNN | Cosine Similarity | Python** <br>
In this project I built recommender system with content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. I've also done EDA and explore most/top Animes based on rank, favorites, rated, popularity, etc (demographic filtering).

#

<img align="left" src="img/cust-churn-img.jpeg" width="240" height="144"> **[Customer Churn Prediction, EDA, and Clustering](https://github.com/laurensiavee/customer-churn-prediction)**<br>
**Machine Learning | Classification | EDA | Clustering | PCA | Unsupervised Learning | Python** <br>
In this project, I analyse the data and find churn correlation with feature listed. Then, I compared several Machine Learning Classification Algorithm such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, etc. Model shown up to 88% Churn Prediction accuracy. I've also tried to Cluster Customer with K-Means and DBSCAN with PCA dimensionality reduction.

#

<img align="left" src="img/fraud.png" width="240" height="144"> **[Fraud Detection on Job Posting](https://github.com/laurensiavee/fraud-job-posting)**<br>
**Natural Language Processing | Machine Learning | Classification | EDA | Python** <br>
In this project, I build Fraud Detection with Machine Learning Classification Model. The Challenge on building Fraud detection is the highly skewed dataset(here fraudulent was only 4,8%). There's also overfit problem, and i've both solve the issue. Model shown up to 86% accuracy.

#

<img align="left" src="img/insurance.jpg" width="240" height="144"> **[Medical Cost Prediction: Insurance Forecast with R](https://github.com/laurensiavee/insurance-medical-cost-pred)**<br>
**Regression | Machine Learning | EDA | R** <br>
In this project, I build Insurance Medical Cost Analysis and Prediction Using Linear Regression Model using R. I experiment data analysis and visualization with ggplot2 library.

## MINOR PROJECTS

#

**[Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/laurensiavee/mnist-digit-recognition)**<br>
**CNN | Image Recognition | MNIST | Keras | TensorFlow | Python** <br>
simple exercise to build Image Recognition of MNIST Digit Dataset with Convolutional Neural Networks. The accuracy reached 99.3%
#

**[Sentiment Analysis on Covid Tweets](https://github.com/laurensiavee/covid-tweets-sentiment)**<br>
**Sentiment Analysis | NLP | Classification | BERT |TensorFlow | Python** <br>
classified sentiment of tweets related to covid into 5 categories. Used BERT as tokenizer and pretrained classifier build with neural network. Accuracy reached 80%.
#

**[Orange vs Grape](https://github.com/laurensiavee/orange-vs-grape)**<br>
**Machine Learning | Classification | EDA | Prediction | Python** <br>

fun and simple Machine Learning exercise to build classifier model for citrus data (orange vs grape). Used 5 different machine learning algorithm with accuracy between 91.9% - 98.5%

#

**[Simple Calculator](https://github.com/laurensiavee/simple-calculator)**<br>
**HTML | CSS | JavaScript** <br>
simple  calculator as exercise on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
