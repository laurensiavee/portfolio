# PORTFOLIO
Hello, I'm Laurensia! Welcome to my portfolio!

I am currently on my third year of Computer Science MajorðŸ”­, Specialize in âœ¨Intelligence System/ Artificial Intelligenceâœ¨.I am currently focused in learning Machine Learning and Data Science. I mainly used Python, and some R. My current interest is Machine Learning Model Deployment. And so, I am currently learning Web Development (Flask).

<br/>

Portfolio contain compilation of personal project, mainly Data Science and Machine Learning projects, updated on regular basis.

## PROJECTS

#

<img align="left" src="img/1_kny.png" width="240" height="144"> **[Anime Recommender System: Content-based and Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/laurensiavee/anime-recommender)**<br>
**Information Retrieval | TF-IDF | KNN | Cosine Similarity | Python** <br>
In this project I built recommender system with content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. I've also done EDA and explore most/top Animes based on rank, favorites, rated, popularity, etc (demographic filtering).

#

<img align="left" src="img/cust-churn-img.jpeg" width="240" height="144"> **[Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis](https://github.com/laurensiavee/customer-churn-prediction)**<br>
**Machine Learning | Classification | EDA | Prediction | Python** <br>
In this project, I analyse the data and find churn correlation with feature listed. Then, I compared several Machine Learning Classification Algorithm such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, etc. Model shown up to 88% Churn Prediction accuracy.

#

<img align="left" src="img/fraud.png" width="240" height="144"> **[Fraud Detection on Job Posting](https://github.com/laurensiavee/customer-churn-prediction)**<br>
**Natural Language Processing | Machine Learning | Classification | EDA | Python** <br>
In this project, I build Fraud Detection with Machine Learning Classification Model. The Challenge on building Fraud detection is the highly skewed dataset(here fraudulent was only 4,8%). There's also overfit problem, and i've both solve the issue. Model shown up to 86% accuracy.

#

## MINOR PROJECTS

#

**[Orange vs Grape](https://github.com/laurensiavee/orange-vs-grape)**<br>
**Machine Learning | Classification | EDA | Prediction | Python** <br>
fun and simple Machine Learning exercise to build classifier model for citrus data (orange vs grape). Used 5 different machine learning algorithm with accuracy between 91.9% - 98.5%

#

**[Simple Calculator](https://github.com/laurensiavee/simple-calculator)**<br>
**HTML | CSS | JavaScript** <br>
simple  calculator as exercise on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
